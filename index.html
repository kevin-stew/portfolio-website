                <p>Born down-state, raised in the northern burbs, and a resident of the Big City for much of my adult life, I am an Illinoisan through-and-through. 
                    I've had a chance to travel the world, and also  in different parts of the US, and while I enjoy traveling and experienceing other places a lot, I am always drawn back to the Windy City and its awesome lake.
                    In keeping with one might expect of a true Chicagoan, one of my favorite foods is deep-dish (Pizano's if I had to choose), I enjoy listening to Chicago blues at live venues, and I'm a lifelong White Sox fan.

                <p>I went to college at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for College.  
                    Because I graduate from undergrad right as the Great Recession of 2008 was happening, I ended up sticking around for a masters to weather the economic storm.  
                    My undergraduate degree is in Urban and Regional Planning, and my graduate degree is in Landscape Architecture.  
                    Here's a link to some design-as-art projects I undertook with a professor near the end of my schooling there: <a href="https://cargocollective.com/analogmedialab/">Analog-Media-Lab</a>

                    <P> Throughout my life I've spent about 2.5 years living and working abroad.  My first experience was during my entire senior year of high school as a foreign exchange student in Germany.      
                        Later I life I would return to try living and working there on my own terms after college.   
                        Over the years I have had several chances to travel extensively throughout Europe, and even got to go on a couple of work trips to Saudi Arabia. Traveling is fun, I look forward to doing more trips after the Pandemic has mostly subsided.

                    <p> After college I began my career in Landscpae Architecture in Chicago, working for various local design firms. 
                        Although most of my early projects focused on corperate campus design and regional shopping developments (aka outdoor malls), eventually I would find my way into more urban projects.

                        After a couple of polar vortex winters in Chicago, I got an itch to try a different scene, and a different part of the industry.
                        I applied for a job at a Colorado-based company in 2016 and soon relocated near Aspen, CO.  
                        While there I spent three years working on high-end residential projects (aka extremely fancy backyards) and mountain resort developments.  
                        One of the more interesting projects I worked involved 3D scanning boulders for precision placement in a backyard pool, check it out here:

                        <br>
                        In 2019 I returned to Chicago to be closer to family and friends.  
                        I also wanted to pursue project work that was more readily located in urban contexts and that affected the general public (not just private property owners).  
                        Since then, and until Fall of 2021, I had been working for a landscape design firm specializing in on-structure projects, meaning amenity decks on skyscapers, 
                        and urban parks built on structure.

                    <P> I have come to recently believe it is not only important to be a savvy user of technology, but to play an active role in its development.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        During the pandemic, when I realized I was spending all of my time in front of a screen, I felt like I was limited to just being a user of apps, websites, and software 
                        created by someone else.  Sure, I could develop content on platforms made by others as much as I wanted, but at the end of the day I didn’t have the feeling like I was ever going to be able to control, or deeply engage with, all of the technology influencing my life.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/tech_2.jpg" class="main-images">
                        <br>
                        Also, when compared to any other industry currently, tech developer jobs are expected to outpace the growth of just about every other industry and profession for the foreseeable future.  Now is as good a time as any to enter into this fast growing sector, with so much room for growth and specialization.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Although my background is in design, I am currently interested in the back-end of the developer side of things, namely programming and data.  
                        I think the emerging fields of Business Intelligence and Data Analytics are pretty interesting, as well as Machine Learning and Algorithms.
                        But regardless of what I’m interested in now, I will be open minded to all aspects of the industry.  
                        There is much to learn, and I am excited to take this first step in a much longer journey with Coding Temple!
